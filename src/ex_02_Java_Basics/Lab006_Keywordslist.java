    /*-
    Simple English words which are having predefined meaning in 'Java Programming Language.'
    - Keywords are also called "Reserved Words."
    - All the keywords are defined in "Lower Case."
    - "can’t use keywords" as names for variables, methods, classes, or as any other identifiers

    ** How many keywords are present in the Java JDK 24?**
        Java JDK 24 contains 54 reserved keywords. (54 RW)
        Contextual Keywords (Introduced in Modern Java) ( 17-3) - Total - **68** Keywords

        Key Rules for Keywords
        Reserved: They cannot be used as identifiers for naming variables, methods, or classes.
        Case-Sensitive: All keywords must be written in lowercase (e.g., if is a keyword, but IF is not).
        Literals vs. Keywords: Words like true, false, and null are literals, not keywords, but they are also reserved and cannot be used as identifiers.
        Common Keywords by Category

        Data Types: int, float, double, char, boolean, byte, short, long, void.
        Control Flow: if, else, switch, case, default, for, while, do, break, continue, return.
        Access Modifiers: public, private, protected.
        OOP & Modifiers: class, interface, extends, implements, new, this, super, abstract, final, static.
        Exception Handling: try, catch, finally, throw, throws, assert.
        Synchronization: synchronized, volatile.
        Memory & Serialization: transient, native.
        New & Contextual Keywords (Java 9+)
        Contextual keywords only act as keywords in specific contexts (like within a module declaration).
        Local Variable Inference: var (Java 10).
        Modules: module, requires, exports, opens, uses, provides, with, to, transitive (Java 9).
        Data Carriers & Sealed Types: record (Java 16), sealed, non-sealed, permits (Java 17).
        Switch Expressions: yield (Java 14).

        new	Creates new objects.
        this	Refers to the current object.
        super	Refers to the superclass of the current object.
        abstract	Declares a class or method that must be implemented in a subclass.
        final	Prevents inheritance, overriding, or modification.
        static	Declares class-level variables or methods.
        sealed	Restricts which classes can extend a given class.
        permits	Specifies the subclasses allowed to extend a sealed class.
