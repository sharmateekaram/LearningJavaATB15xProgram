                In Java, keywords and identifiers are the basic building blocks used to write programs.
                Keywords provide the language's structure and commands,
                while identifiers are the custom names you give to various elements like variables and classes.
                 1. Keywords in Java
                Keywords are predefined, reserved words that have a special meaning to the Java compiler. You cannot use them as identifiers.
                Total Count: There are over 50 keywords in modern Java (some sources specify 53 as of Java 21).
                Case Sensitivity: Keywords are always written in lowercase. For example, while is a keyword, but While is not.
                Reserved but Unused: goto and const are reserved keywords but have no current function in Java.
                Literals: true, false, and null are not technically keywords but are reserved literals that also cannot be used as identifiers.
                Common Keywords by Category:
                Data Types: int, float, double, char, boolean, byte, short, long.
                Control Flow: if, else, switch, case, default, while, do, for, break, continue, return.
                Access Modifiers: public, private, protected, static.
                Class/Object Related: class, interface, extends, implements, new, this, super, abstract, final.
                Exception Handling: try, catch, finally, throw, throws.

                2. Identifiers in Java
                Identifiers are user-defined names given to variables, methods, classes, packages, and interfaces.
                Rules for Naming Identifiers
                Allowed Characters: Must consist of letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), underscores (_), or dollar signs ($).
                Starting Character: Must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign. It cannot start with a digit (e.g., 1variable is invalid).
                No Keywords: An identifier cannot be a reserved Java keyword or literal.
                Case Sensitive: myVar and myvar are considered two different identifiers.
                No Spaces: Spaces and special characters (like @, #, -) are not allowed.
                Length: There is no limit on the length, but it should be meaningful and readable.
                        Naming Conventions (Best Practices)
                Classes/Interfaces: Use PascalCase (e.g., StudentDetails, DataProcessor).
                Variables/Methods: Use camelCase (e.g., totalAmount, calculateSalary).
                Constants: Use UPPER_CASE with underscores (e.g., MAX_VALUE, PI_VALUE).
                Descriptive Names: Choose names that reflect the purpose (e.g., userAge instead of a).

                Feature 	Keywords	Identifiers
                Definition	Predefined, reserved words	Names created by programmers
                Purpose	Defines language syntax/commands	Labels code elements (variables, etc.)

                Case	Always lowercase	Any combination of upper/lowercase
                Examples	int, while, public, class	age, studentName, calculateTotal
